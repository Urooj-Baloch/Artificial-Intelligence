QUESTION 1:

In 1950, Alan Turing wrote a paper called "Computing Machinery and Intelligence," where he asked, "Can machines think?" He suggested the Turing Test to check if a machine can act like a human. Turing expected people to disagree and gave answers to some common objections. This essay looks at which objections still matter, if Turing’s answers were good, new problems with AI, and his prediction about the Turing Test.

Objections That Still Matter:

Mathematical Limits: 
Some say machines can’t do everything because of math limits. Turing argued humans have limits too, but some believe human intuition goes beyond machines.
Consciousness:
People say machines don’t think because they don’t feel or know themselves. Turing said behavior is enough to prove intelligence, but today’s AI talks like humans without real understanding.

Lady Lovelace’s Objection: 
She said machines can’t create new ideas. Turing believed machines could surprise us. Today, AI creates art and music, but people still wonder if it’s real creativity.

Are His Answers Good?

Turing’s answers were smart and ahead of his time. His idea that behavior shows intelligence makes sense, but his answer to Lady Lovelace’s Objection misses the fact that human creativity includes emotions and self-awareness.

New Problems Today:

Ethical Issues: Today’s AI brings up questions about privacy, bias, and control, which Turing didn’t predict.
Superintelligent AI: Some worry that AI might become too powerful and out of human control.
Real Understanding vs. Imitation: Today’s AI can copy human conversation but doesn’t really understand the meaning.

Turing’s Prediction:

Turing predicted that by 2000, machines would have a 30% chance of passing a five-minute Turing Test. This means they could trick someone into thinking they were human. This didn’t fully happen by 2000, but today’s AI, like ChatGPT, can do it in short talks, even though it doesn’t truly understand.


QUESTION 2:

Playing a Decent Game of Table Tennis (Ping-Pong):
Current Status: AI systems for table tennis are still developing. It is hard to make an AI that can play at a high level because it needs to see the ball quickly, decide fast, and move with great accuracy.
Challenges: The main problems are fast visual processing, predicting where the ball will go, and moving quickly and precisely.

Playing a Decent Game of Bridge at a Competitive Level:
Current Status: AI is good at games like chess and Go, but bridge is harder because of hidden information and teamwork. AI can play bridge reasonably well but not at the top human level.
Challenges: It is difficult because AI must guess opponents' cards, make bidding strategies, and work with a partner, all while dealing with uncertainty.

Writing an Intentionally Funny Story:
Current Status: AI can write stories and mimic styles but struggles to be truly funny. Humor depends on culture, wordplay, and deep understanding, which AI finds hard to master.
Challenges: Humor involves timing, double meanings, and cultural knowledge, making it tough for AI to create jokes that humans find funny.

Giving Competent Legal Advice in a Specialized Area of Law:
Current Status: AI helps with legal research and contract analysis but cannot fully provide expert legal advice in specialized fields. It lacks deep contextual understanding and the ability to interpret complex legal language.
Challenges: Law is complex and often unclear, requiring human judgment to understand evolving rules and case law.

Discovering and Proving a New Mathematical Theorem:
Current Status: AI can prove existing theorems and explore large combinations of possibilities. However, it struggles to create new theorems because it lacks the creative insight of human mathematicians.
Challenges: AI can find proofs but does not have the deep understanding needed to make new discoveries or guide complex proof strategies.

Performing a Surgical Operation:
Current Status: Robots guided by surgeons are used in surgeries for precision tasks. But fully autonomous surgical procedures are not possible yet.
Challenges: Surgery needs quick decision-making, adaptability, and deep knowledge of human anatomy, which are difficult for AI to handle alone.

Unloading Any Dishwasher in Any Home:
Current Status: Some robots can unload dishwashers, but they struggle with different dish shapes, sizes, and various dishwasher designs.
Challenges: The main issues are recognizing different objects, handling them safely, and adapting to different home environments.

Constructing a Building:
Current Status: AI is used in building design and project planning but not in physical construction. Most construction tasks still require human workers.
Challenges: Building construction needs problem-solving, flexibility, and complex manual skills that are hard for robots to replicate.

QUESTION 3:

Domain: Smart Appointment Scheduler
Description of Agent:
The Smart Appointment Scheduler Agent helps users efficiently schedule, reschedule, and manage appointments. It integrates with calendars, sends reminders, and optimizes time slots based on user availability and preferences.

Environment Characterization:

Accessible: Partially accessible. The agent has access to calendar data but may lack full visibility of external factors (e.g., unexpected events).
Deterministic: Non-deterministic. User behavior and last-minute changes can impact the schedule.
Episodic: Non-episodic. Decisions depend on past appointments and future availability.
Static: Dynamic. Appointments and availability change over time.
Continuous: Continuous. Time and scheduling are ongoing without discrete states.
Best Agent Architecture:

Hybrid Architecture is most suitable, combining:

Model-based Reflex Agent: For reacting to real-time changes (e.g., cancellations).
Goal-based Agent: To optimize scheduling according to user preferences.
Learning Agent: To adapt to user habits over time, like preferred meeting times.


QUESTION 4: 

1- False: A poker player (partial info) can still make rational decisions using probabilities.

2- True: Chess requires memory; a reflex agent cannot plan ahead.

3- True: In a single-state, single-action environment, every agent is rational.

4- False: Agent program input = current percept; agent function input = percept history.

5- False: Agent functions requiring infinite resources (e.g., halting problem) are unimplementable.

6- True: In a deterministic environment where all actions are equally optimal, a random agent is rational.

7- True: An agent maximizing reward in a grid world can also be rational in a modified grid world with compatible goals.
